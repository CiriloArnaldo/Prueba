## 5 - BLOCKQUOTES

Usar el caret o circumflex (Circumflejo)  
I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

## 6 - UNORDERED AND ORDERED LISTS

Usar * para crear elementos en la lista y además la identación para crear jerarquias

* Tintin
  * A reporter
  * Has poofy orange hair
  * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock

    * Possibly also scotch?

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

    Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

    If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!  

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
    
    Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.

4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes


## 7 - HARD BREAK AND SOFT BREAK IN PARAGRAPHS

Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

>This is what's known as a hard break; what our poetry asks for is a soft break. You can accomplish this by inserting two spaces after each new line. This is not possible to see, since spaces are invisible, but it'd look something like this:

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

Do I contradict myself?   
Very well then I contradict myself,  
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
